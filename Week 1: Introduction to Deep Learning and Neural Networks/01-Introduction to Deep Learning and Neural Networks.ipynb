    "# Day 1: Introduction to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Explanation\n",
    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that mimics the structure and functionality of the human brain through artificial neural networks. These networks consist of interconnected layers of \"neurons\" that process data hierarchically. Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "A neural network is composed of:\n",
    "1. **Input Layer:** Takes in raw data (features like temperature, pressure, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers:** Perform intermediate computations, transforming the data.\n",
    "3. **Output Layer:** Produces predictions or classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neuron\n",
    "- A neuron receives inputs, applies weights to them, adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Representation:**\n",
    "  $z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\dots + b$  \n",
    "  Where:  \n",
    "  - $w$ = weight  \n",
    "  - $x$ = input  \n",
    "  - $b$ = bias  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation Function\n",
    "Non-linear functions introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns.  \n",
    "Common activation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sigmoid:**\n",
    "   $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$  \n",
    "   (Output between 0 and 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**\n",
    "   $f(z) = \\max(0, z)$  \n",
    "   (Removes negative values)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Propagation\n",
    "The process where input data flows through the network layer by layer to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "Measures how far the network’s predictions are from the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Cross-Entropy Loss:\n",
    "$Loss = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i)\\right]$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}_i$ = predicted output  \n",
    "- $y_i$ = actual output  \n",
    "- $m$ = number of samples  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Learning Happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Propagation:**\n",
    "   - Input data is transformed into predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation:**\n",
    "   - The loss function computes the error between predictions and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backpropagation:**\n",
    "   - The loss is propagated backward to adjust the weights and biases using optimization algorithms like **Gradient Descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "   - Reduces the need for manual feature engineering by automatically learning patterns from raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complex Patterns:**\n",
    "   - Models non-linear relationships and complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - Works efficiently with large datasets and high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Applications\n",
    "- **Predictive Maintenance:** Identifying equipment failures in oil and gas fields.\n",
    "- **Reservoir Characterization:** Analyzing well logs for hydrocarbon identification.\n",
    "- **Seismic Analysis:** Extracting features from seismic data for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "Now that you understand the theory, we’ll proceed to:\n",
    "1. Implement a simple neural network in Python.\n",
    "2. Perform forward propagation.\n",
    "3. Visualize how the neural network processes and classifies data.\n",
